However, associated high-voltage interfacial degradation processes require strategies for effective electrode surface passivation. Here, we show that an acidic surface treatment of a Li-rich NMC layered oxide cathode material leads to a substantial suppression of CO2 and O2 evolution, ~90% and ~100% respectively, during the first charge up to 4.8 V vs. Li+/0. CO2 suppression is related to Li2CO3 removal as well as effective surface passivation against electrolyte degradation. This treatment does not result in any loss of discharge capacity and provides superior long-term cycling and rate performance compared to as-received, untreated materials. We also quantify the extent of lattice oxygen participation in charge compensation (“O-redox”) during Li+ removal by a novel ex-situ acid titration. Our results indicate that the peroxo-like species resulting from O-redox originate on the surface at least 300 mV earlier than the activation plateau region around 4.5 V. X-ray photoelectron spectra and Mn-L X-ray absorption spectra of the cathode powders reveal a Li+ deficiency and a partial reduction of Mn ions on the surface of the acid-treated material. More interestingly, although the irreversible oxygen evolution is greatly suppressed through the surface treatment, our O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering shows the lattice O-redox behavior largely sustained. The acidic treatment, therefore, only optimizes the surface of the Li-rich material and almost eliminates the irreversible gas evolution, leading to improved cycling and rate performance. This work therefore presents a simple yet effective approach to passivate cathode surfaces against interfacial instabilities during high-voltage battery operation.","tags":[],"title":"Extended Interfacial Stability Through Simple Acid Rinsing in a Li-Rich Oxide Cathode Material","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571271600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571271600,"objectID":"331c18232017063380230037b0e17f2a","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/talk/ecs2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-19T10:10:30-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ecs2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"236th Electrochemical Society Meeting 2019","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568647154,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568647154,"objectID":"4b63ccb28827f9a0cd62e7ba69312de7","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/project/setco2/","publishdate":"2019-09-16T08:19:14-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/setco2/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Single electron transfer promotes CO2 activation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568641747,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568641747,"objectID":"3dc03311243e347f0be8476f70f9cd00","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/project/coazpy/","publishdate":"2019-09-16T06:49:07-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/coazpy/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Multi-electron reduction in first row complexes","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568641734,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568641734,"objectID":"07a178cf5941abd61328358e2c2cf002","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/project/dft/","publishdate":"2019-09-16T06:48:54-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/dft/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"DFT-based screening of metals and ligands for electro-catalysis","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568641724,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568641724,"objectID":"b890929ec0f1507d27cca707b8f14cbb","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/project/lirich/","publishdate":"2019-09-16T06:48:44-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/lirich/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"High-Voltage Interfacial Stability in Advanced Li-ion Battery Cathode Materials","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568640406,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568640406,"objectID":"8783c7e3e0c5f5dfd3556b0cb03426bd","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/project/co2ins/","publishdate":"2019-09-16T06:26:46-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/co2ins/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Ligand Effects on the Free Energy of CO2 Insertion into an M-H bond","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1566759052,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566759052,"objectID":"5b0d3112ca7bb60066e47a45b5ff26a1","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/project/mh_echem/","publishdate":"2019-08-25T11:50:52-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/mh_echem/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Electro-chemistry of Metal Hydride Complexes","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564862937,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564862937,"objectID":"583bc6c089052d23ac6c3a855c17f6df","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/posts/my-first-post/","publishdate":"2019-08-03T13:08:57-07:00","relpermalink":"/posts/my-first-post/","section":"posts","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My First Post","type":"posts"},{"authors":["Srinivasan Ramakrishnan","Ross A.

The goal is to minimize the free energy corrugations between reactants, catalytic intermediates and each desired product, simultaneously screening against intermediates with low free energy that would be traps, and against necessary intermediates with high free energy. Catalysts are initially screened for those with: (a) standard state free energy of the metal hydride intermediate ergoneutral with HCO2−, which is the lowest energy product with weak proton donors, and (b) standard free energy of the metal carbonyl intermediate sufficiently high to avoid trapping. The design method is tested on a diverse range of ligands including cyclopentadienyl, polypyridyl, amino, phosphino and carbonyl ligands, around three earth-abundant d6 transition metal ions, Mn(I), Fe(II) and Co(III), using the BP86 density functional, the double-zeta 6-31+G* basis, LANL2DZ effective core potential on the metals and SMD polarizable continuum model for acetonitrile as solvent, which have previously provided chemically accurate values of several redox potentials, pKa's and ligand exchange equilibria for transition metal complexes. Among the 36 complexes screened, an Fe(II) center ligated to two bipyridines and a pyridine with a solvent-bound sixth coordination site for hydride formation from phenol as the proton donor is identified as a promising candidate for ergoneutral hydride formation without trapping by CO. The redox-active bipyridine ligands are predicted to provide near ergoneutral sites for accumulating the two electrons needed to form the hydride. To test the predictions, an Fe(II) complex was prepared with the desired ligand environment using a pentadentate ligand to prevent ligand exchange. The synthesized complex was indeed found to be active towards electrocatalytic proton reduction as well as CO2 reduction at the predicted redox potentials with no trapping by CO. However, contrary to the in silico predictions, we found electrochemical evidence of CO2 binding after the first reduction leading to CO production. Mapping the free energies of key catalytic intermediates such as the metal hydride and metal carbonyl species by using density functional theory (DFT) serves as a first step in catalyst screening spanning large libraries of metals and ligands. In order to screen against all the intermediates in the catalytic pathway, such as reduced metal-bound CO2 intermediates, further refinement and validation of the DFT methods are needed.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping free energy regimes in electrocatalytic reductions to screen transition metal-based catalysts","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560384000,"objectID":"3cbb13f36fe67bd8fbd8c834ffc0ac08","permalink":"https://sriniramk.github.io/talk/oxford2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-04T11:07:29-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/oxford2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Department of Materials, University of Oxford","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Elizabeth A.

The overall two-electron process leads to the generation of a CO-bound ruthenium complex, [Ru-CO]+, and carbonate, as independently confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Simulations of the cyclic voltammograms using DigiElch together with density functional theory based calculations reveal that the singly reduced ruthenium complex [Ru-S]0 binds CO2 at a rate of ca. 105 M–1 s–1 at almost zero driving force. Subsequent to CO2 binding, all of the steps leading up to deoxygenation are highly exergonic and rapid. A model of the potential energy profile of the CO2 approach to the Ru center in the singly reduced manifold reveals a direct correlation between the reactivity toward CO2 and the nucleophilicity at the metal center influenced by different ligand environments. Through the binding of CO2 after the first reduction, overpotentials associated with consecutive electrochemical reductions are avoided. This work therefore provides an important design principle for engineering transition-metal complexes to activate CO2 under low driving forces.","tags":null,"title":"Initiation of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 by a Singly Reduced Ruthenium(II) Bipyridine Complex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kate M.

Crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization together with experimentally calibrated density functional theory calculations illuminate the key structural and electronic changes that occur upon reduction of 1 to 2. The electrochemical potential inversion observed with 1 is attributed to effective overlap between the metal d and the low-energy azo π* orbitals in the intermediary redox state and additional stabilization of 2 from structural reorganization, leading to a two-electron reduction.

The calculated reaction coordinate for acetone insertion involves a stepwise outer-sphere dihydrogen transfer to acetone via hydride transfer from the metal and proton transfer from the N–H group on the CNN ligand. In contrast, the lowest energy pathway calculated for CO2 insertion proceeds by an initial Ru–H hydride transfer to CO2 followed by rotation of the resulting N–H-stabilized formate to a Ru–O-bound formate. DFT calculations were used to evaluate the influence of the ancillary ligands on the thermodynamics of CO2 insertion, revealing that increasing the π acidity of the ligand cis to the hydride ligand and increasing the σ basicity of the ligand trans to it decreases the free energy of CO2 insertion, providing a strategy for the design of metal hydride systems capable of reversible, ergoneutral interconversion of CO2 and formate.","tags":null,"title":"Experimental and Theoretical Study of CO2 Insertion into Ruthenium Hydride Complexes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Srinivasan Ramakrishnan","Sumit Chakraborty","William W.
