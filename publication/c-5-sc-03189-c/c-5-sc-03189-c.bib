 abstract = {A series of square-planar nickel hydride complexes supported by bis(phosphinite) pincer ligands with varying substituents (–OMe, –Me, and –But) on the pincer backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography. Their cyclic voltammograms show irreversible oxidation peaks (peak potentials from 101 to 316 mV vs. Fc+/Fc) with peak currents consistent with overall one-electron oxidations. Chemical oxidation by the one-electron oxidant Ce(NBu4)2(NO3)6 was studied by NMR spectroscopy, which provided quantitative evidence for post-oxidative H2 evolution leading to a solvent-coordinated nickel(ii) species with the pincer backbone intact. Bulk electrolysis of the unsubstituted nickel hydride (3a) showed an overall one-electron stoichiometry and gas chromatographic analysis of the headspace gas after electrolysis further confirmed stoichiometric production of dihydrogen. Due to the extremely high rate of the post-oxidative chemical process, electrochemical simulations have been used to establish a lower limit of the bimolecular rate constant (kf > 107 M−1 s−1) for the H2 evolution step. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest known oxidative H2 evolution process observed in transition metal hydrides. Quantum chemical calculations based on DFT indicate that the one-electron oxidation of the nickel hydride complex provides a strong chemical driving force (−90.3 kcal mol−1) for the production of H2 at highly oxidizing potentials.},
